  # The Conductor container does the heavy lifting, and provides a portable
  # Python runtime for building your target containers. It should be derived
  # from the same distribution as you're building your target containers with.
  conductor_base: ubuntu:16.04

  # The deployment_output_path is mounted to the Conductor container, and the 
  # `run` and `deployment` commands then write generated Ansible playbooks to it.

  # When using the k8s or openshift engines, use the following to authorize with the API.
  # Values set here will be passed to the Ansible modules. Any file paths will be mounted
  # to the conductor container, allowing the `run` command to access the API.
  #k8s_auth:
    # path to a K8s config file
    #config_file:
    # name of a context found within the config.json file
    #context:
    # URL for accessing the K8s API
    #host:
    # An API authentication token
    #api_key:
    # Path to a ca cert file
    #ssl_ca_cert:
    # Path to a cert file

  # When using the k8s or openshift engines, use the following to set the namespace.
  # If not set, the project name will be used. For openshift, the namespace maps to a project,

  # Add your containers here, specifying the base image you want to build from.
